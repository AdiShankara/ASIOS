# ASIOS
### The Operating System that runs ASIET
The Adi Shankara Institute's computers run on this Linux OS based off of Ubuntu 18.04 (). The OS is based off of Ubuntu, peeled off of all bloat and built in order to specifically support the systems at the institute. This is a product of the work done in the direction of being self sufficient and Open Source in all respects, supporting freedom of knowledge.
